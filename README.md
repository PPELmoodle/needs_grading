## Motivation
To make the correction work easier for tutors and lecturers.
They always have to go to the individual site to see how many remaining assignments to be corrected. 

## Goal
The goal of this project is that we make the block to give an overview of the number of ungraded assignments. The number is then displayed in a block for the respective course. The target group is the people who have correction authority, for example tutors or professors.

## Used Stack
php, postgreSQL 12.5, HTML, CSS
